          <h3>SeaGlide Competition</h3>
          <p>
            After the shortcomings of First Tech Challenge Open Qualifier at Lincoln High School, 
            the team focused on another competition, SeaGlide. With only a month left until the competition, 
            the team worked to assemble the underwater drone and develop other design parts that can be attached to the drone.
            Alongside the underwater drone, the white research paper and presentation were developed.
            The day before the competition, the team has a virtual meeting with the people who run the competition at temple
            and it turns out debateable successful. The day of the competition arrives and the team faces major setbacks 
            with the underwater drone not functioning and only having one laptop to work with. Half the team splits, 
            one half attempts to fix the underwater drone while the other half goes to do the bug hunt with a borrowed laptop. 
            The attempt to fix the underwater drone proved to be minimal and the bug hunt had minimal success.
            In the end, despite all the setbacks and failures, the team managed to take victories in two categories, 1st in presentation
            and 2nd in white paper.
